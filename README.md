# Roger Dodger
Rodger Dodger is just a simple dodger game (dodge falling blocks and survive as long as possible) to familiarize myself with C++. This project uses the SFML framework.

## Currently it has:
* score points
* hit points
* a hud to show both the score and HP left
* player invincibilty on being hit (player goes slightly transparent)
* a start, playing, and game over screen
* pausing and restarting
* background music when playing
* sound effect for being hit

## What I think I'd like to add:
* your score increases when you're close to a falling block, but don't touch it.
